Excellent job, Princess! I think your models are set up really nicely. You did a really good job.

A couple comments:
* you may want to review eager loading with associations. It allows you to get data from one particular model and also include any associated models with one database query. more comments in the `server.js` file.
* check out the ENUM dataType in sequelize. more comments in the `SouthPark.js` file.
* you dont need to destructure and import objects/models if you dont use them in a file.
